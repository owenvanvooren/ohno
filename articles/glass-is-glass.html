            <div class="post-content">
                Well, I sure wasn't kidding when I said this week would be a big one for the tech industry!
                    <br>
                    <br>Once again, there's a lot to unpack this week, so let's get to it!
                    <br>
                    <br>Like I said in <a href="https://ohno.owen.uno/articles/a-big-week-in-tech">last week's post</a>,
                    Apple's WWDC kicked off on Monday, and tech media is still buzzing about the announcements made
                    during the keynote.
                    <br>I've been using the macOS 26 (named Tahoe, after the lake on the border of California and
                    Nevada) Developer Beta on my MacBook Air since Monday, so I'll be touching on my personal experience
                    with the new design and features.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let's go alphabetically through the news, just for fun...
                    <br>Apple first, then Browser Company of New York, then Xbox.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>Liquid Glass: My thoughts</h3>
                <h4>At WWDC, Apple announced a whole new UI.</h4>Liquid Glass is Apple's new material for the entire
                Apple software ecosystem, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS.
                <br>Here's what Apple Human Interface VP Alan Dye had to say about it in the keynote:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><i>“...Our goal is a beautiful new design that brings joy and delight to every user experience... and
                        it starts with an entirely new expressive material we call Liquid Glass. With the optical
                        qualities of glass and a fluidity that only Apple can achieve, it transforms depending on your
                        content, or even your context, and brings more clarity to navigation and controls.”</i></b>
                <br>
                <br>Unlike previous redesigns, Liquid Glass is applied everywhere throughout the entire Apple software
                ecosystem.
                <br>Now, this redesign was widely rumored (I expanded upon it in last week's article), but the specifics
                of the design were kept mostly under wraps until the keynote, which helped make the reveal experience
                even more magical and exciting.
                <br>Here's what <i>I</i> said about it beforehand:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><i>“I have to admit, I was a little afraid of what it might look like, especially for macOS, since,
                        as contrasted to iOS/iPadOS or even tvOS, it's <i>designed</i> for productivity instead of
                        (mainly) entertainment.”</i></b>
                <br>
                <br><i>For more context, check <a
                        href="https://ohno.owen.uno/articles/a-big-week-in-tech.html#:~:text=glassmorphic.-,Apple%20is%20rumored%20to,dust%20settles%20on%20Monday.">here</a>.</i>
                <br>
                <br>However, I actually kind of love it. And not because I'm an Apple acolyte or grew up in the age of
                <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Frutiger_Aero">Frutiger Aero.</a>
                <br>It just seems to make so much sense to create a design language that is consistent across all of
                Apple's platforms, and Liquid Glass does just that. It's <a
                    href="https://owen.uno/countdown/?style=glassmorphic">glassmorphic</a> in a way that we haven't seen
                before, and I think that's a good thing.
                <br>Traditionally, glassmorphism has been comprised of an opaque/translucent content background with an
                optional (but widely used) background blur to blur the content behind it and provide a sense of
                hierarchy.
                <br>
                <br>Liquid Glass takes this to the next level, <i>actually mimicking the properties of real glass!!</i>
                <br>As somewhat of a developer myself (although I'm a much better designer than developer), I can
                appreciate the technical achievement that this represents. The new design is also refreshed with new and
                more lively and playful animations, which make every microinteraction that much more fun and engaging.
                <br>
                <br>There <i>are</i> a few quirks, like I'm not a huge fan of the new toggles, and the opacity in
                Control Center on iOS is a little too low (I get why they did it, to let more of the content “shine
                through” the UI elements), but overall, I'm very satisfied and really impressed that Apple pulled this
                off.
                <br>
                <br>Of course, with such a massive design update, there <b>will</b> be users who absolutely despise the
                design. People have widely criticized the design updates, claiming that it's “not a true redesign”,
                citing that while the look and feel has changed, the core navigation has not.
                <br>
                <br>I disagree with that sentiment, and, while it was a bold and risky move on Apple's part, in the long
                term I think they made the right decision.
                <br>
                <br>It seems like people have jumped the gun so much on trying out the design that they forget it's a
                beta. A developer beta. The first one. And then they get angry 'cause they think this is what Apple is
                shipping in September.
                <br>
                <br>And all this is very frustrating for people who are actually used to beta testing, because they know
                that a
                whole lot can (and is supposed to) change between the first developer beta release and the first
                production release. Once, Apple announced a new design for Safari at WWDC21. It shipped in the beta, and
                while it looked cool, most users didn't really like it. So Apple ended up rethinking the design and
                changed it before the first production release.
                <br>
                <br>With such a radical redesign, Apple has needed to change a <i>lot</i> of UI elements, and that means
                that some of them are going to be really buggy.
                <br>Plus, Apple has about three and a half months to iron it out.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>The Other Stuff</h3>
                <h4>There's a whole lot more than meets the eye</h4>Apple didn't just show off a new UI design and leave
                it at that.
                <br>While there were no insane software features announced at WWDC, that doesn't mean it was a
                design-only update.
                <br>First of all, we <i>did</i> get iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS and tvOS 26, as rumored. To learn more
                about <i>why</i>, check out (again) <a href="https://owen.uno/articles/a-big-week-in-tech">last week's
                    article</a>.
                <br>Next, Apple previewed tons of new Apple Intelligence features, and, unlike last year, they were
                delivered at launch. Some new features include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Apple Intelligence in the Shortcuts App</li>
                    <li>Developers can now use the Foundation Models framework to leverage both on-device and Private
                        Cloud Compute Apple Intelligence models in their apps</li>
                    <li>More Image Playground image generation styles (like ChatGPT and Genmoji)</li>
                    <li>Apple Intelligence-powered Live Translation in Messages and FaceTime</li>
                    <li>Visual Intelligence gets an upgrade, with the ability to ask ChatGPT about an item or subject in
                        an image</li>
                    <li>Apple Intelligence comes to Apple Watch, including a new feature called Workout Buddy, which
                        acts as your own real-time fitness coach and motivator</li>
                    <li>Apple Intelligence can now suggest a new Poll in Messages when it notices that one might come in
                        handy</li>
                    <li>...and many more!</li>
                </ul>
                Plus, there were tons of other new features announced, like:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>All-new Games app on iPhone, iPad and Mac for all your (even non-App Store, at least on Mac)
                        games</li>
                    <li>New Liquid Glass-inspired icons, with a brand-new Clear app icon variant (thankfully, the icons
                        aren't rounder though), as well as a new utility for developers to make app icons</li>
                    <li>Customizable folders on iPadOS and macOS</li>
                    <li>New Polls feature in Messages</li>
                    <li>Customizable chat background in Messages</li>
                    <li>Redesigned Camera app (and icon) for quicker access to both core and advanced features</li>
                    <li>Photos app brings back tabs (but only two of them), Library and Collections, plus a Search

                    <li>AutoMix feature in Apple Music seamlessly transitions between songs to create a personal DJ-like
                        experience</li>
                    <li>iPadOS productivity features provide a more Mac-like windowing system</li>

                    <li>Better Personas for visionOS (used in FaceTime calls to spatially recreate your face)</li>
                    <li>Spatial Scenes take a 2D photo and use advanced image processing to create a photo you can move
                        around and look into on visionOS, and it also comes to iOS for your wallpaper, giving an Amazon
                        Fire Phone-like
                        feel</li>
                    <li>...and a couple hundred more I don't have the space in this article to touch up on!</li>
                </ul>
                Overall, while Apple didn't lean as heavily into Apple Intelligence as investors had hoped, the new
                redesign, peppered with lots of quality-of-life features and enhancements made this WWDC one to
                remember.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Dia: The browser that browses for you</h3>
                <h4>Last week I talked about how the Browser Company of New York (BCNY) had said sunset their first
                    browser, Arc. Now we get to take a quick look at their new AI-powered browser, Dia.</h4>
                <a href="https://diabrowser.com">Dia</a> is BCNY's so-called “Act II”. They claimed that Arc didn't go
                as mainstream as they were hoping,
                with its brand-new design being a little too “out there” for average users.
                <br>
                <br>On top of me testing the (relatively unstable) macOS Tahoe beta, I've also been testing the Dia
                beta! <i class="mixed-caps">hOoRaY i LoVe BeTa TeStInG!</i>
                <br>
                <br>To be honest, it's actually been really useful. The whole premise of Dia is to be your sidekick on
                the web, where you can ask Dia about anything on a webpage in a chat sidebar on the right of the browser
                window.
                <br>
                <br>For example, I used Dia to quickly research stuff for this article, like WWDC feature updates I
                missed
                while watching the keynote and feverishly texting my friends in real-time about all the new features.
                <br>
                <br>When you launch Dia, it prompts you to first create an account and stuff (since it's a beta), then
                it lets you craft <i>your own prompts for the AI</i>.
                <br>This gives you a more personalized experience, and I really like the level of guidance BCNY baked
                into the setup, showing you what to do, but not obsessively hand-holding.
                <br>Dia also lets you craft your own AI “Skills”, which let you create a prompt for Dia to complete a
                specific task, like creating an daily schedule first thing in the morning for you, based on your
                personal context that Dia has learned.
                <br>
                <br>Overall, Dia is very useful for things like research and shopping, but I don't really see it as a
                great fit for my regular day-to-day web browser. I really like the Safari redesign, so I'll likely be
                using a combination of Safari and Arc for my usual browsing.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Honey, I shrunk the Xbox</h3>
                <h4>Microsoft's engineering team finally bought a shrink-ray!</h4>Nearly twenty-one years after
                Microsoft gaming competitor Sony announced the PSP (PlayStation Portable), Microsoft partners with ASUS
                to create an Xbox handheld. Gamers rejoice.
                <br>
                <br>Microsoft seems to be aiming to compete with the likes of Valve (with their Steam Deck), and
                Nintendo (with their Switch series of handheld consoles).
                <br>In reality, they're actually releasing <i>two</i> handhelds, the ROG (Republic of Gamers) Xbox Ally
                and the ROG Xbox Ally X. The Ally X is essentially the “Pro” version of the Ally, with more RAM (Random
                Access Memory, which helps apps and games run faster and freeze less), double the storage for games, and
                a bigger battery.
                <br>
                <br>Prices have not yet been announced, but rumors place the Ally at around $499-599 and the Ally X at
                about $699-899.
                <br>
                <br>Microsoft had been rumored to have been working on a first-party gaming console for quite some time,
                but it seems that they've cancelled that project in favor of a partnership with ASUS.
                <br>
                <br>To be honest, I'm not much of a gamer myself at all, and the games I <i>do</i> play regularly are on
                this quirky yellow handheld game console with a crank, called <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>,
                and I've always preferred PlayStation over Xbox, 'cause <s>I dunno, I don't like Microsoft</s> I enjoy
                the PlayStation experience better.
                <br>
                <br>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X consoles are expected to be released just in time for the 2025
                holiday season, so keep that in mind if you're writing your (ultra-expensive) Christmas wishlist.
