                <h3>Face: booked</h3>
                <h4>Yet another device to look through, not at.</h4>It seems like AR (augmented reality) and AI
                (artificial intelligence) are becoming the
                new acronyms of the tech industry, and every big tech company is racing to have their brand associated
                with the best of both worlds.
                <br>Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook (following the trend of creating a parent company for
                itself, like Google did with Alphabet), has been
                at the forefront of the AR headset and AI glasses industry for a while now, with its Meta Quest product
                line (formerly known as Oculus) and its partnership with Ray-Ban to bring smart glasses to the masses
                (wow, it
                rhymes!).
                <br>
                <br>Last week, Meta announced a new collaboration with Oakley, the iconic eyewear brand, to create a new
                pair of AI smart glasses. Oakley is known for its focus on sports eyewear, and this new pair of shades
                is no exception.
                <br>
                <br>The new Oakley + Meta AI Glasses feature an open-ear stereo speaker system, a 12MP camera, a 5
                microphone array, and a touchpad, plus a significantly improved battery life (compared to the Ray-Ban
                AI Glasses).
                <br>
                <br>Pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/">Oakley + Meta HSTN
                    Special Edition Glasses</a> open on July 11th, priced at $499. Meta
                announced that the full lineup (starting at $399) of Oakley + Meta AI Glasses will be available this
                summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Collab Time!!</h3>
                <h4>Who doesn't like having two hi-res screens strapped directly in front of their eyeballs? (asking for
                    a friend)</h4>Meta <i>and</i> Xbox have both recently announced new product collaborations, such as
                Meta's partnership with Oakley that I just wrote about, and Xbox's collab with Asus to create the ROG
                Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, <a
                    href="https://ohno.owen.uno/articles/glass-is-glass#:~:text=Honey%2C%20I%20shrunk,a%20shrink%2Dray!">which
                    I wrote about two weeks ago.</a>
                <br>
                <br>So it's not much of a surprise that they both decided to team up and create a special edition
                version of the Meta Quest 3S, the latest in Meta's line of VR headsets. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition
                comes in a sleek black colorway, accented with the signature Xbox green, with matching accessories.
                <br>
                <br>Keep in mind that it's not really a <i>new</i> product, but rather an Xbox-themed version of the
                existing Meta Quest 3S.
                <br>Despite this, the headset sold out within three days of being announced on June 24th.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>A <s>yuge</s> huge backpedal</h3>
                <h4>What happens on the internet stays on the internet.</h4>The <a
                    href="https://trumpmobile.com/t1-phone">T1 phone from the Trump Organization</a> looked fishy from
                the start.
                <br>
                It claimed to be “Made in America” yet was priced at just $499, didn't have any processor specs
                available, had a painfully bad photoshop job for the product image, and used a headphone jack.
                <br>
                <br>The phone was announced in early June to celebrate the 10th anniversary of President Trump's first
                presidential campaign launch.
                <br>
                <br>Now, just a few weeks later, the Trump Phone is no longer advertised as being made in America, one
                of the phone's primary selling points. A slogan replaces the original “Proudly Made in America” tagline,
                now reading “American-Proud Design”.
                <br>
                <br>It looks like the Trump Organization may have switched suppliers for the phone (but critics say that
                it's very likely that they were planning on it being made in China all along), as the specs page for the
                phone changes the original “6.8"(6.78")Punch Hole AMOLED Screen” with “6.25 inch Punch Hole AMOLED
                Screen”, and removing the RAM specs altogether, as spotted by <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/693080/trump-mobile-t1-phone-made-usa">The Verge</a>.
                <br>
                <br>Despite all this, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told CNN that <a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/tech/trump-t1-phone-made-in-us-website-change#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cthe%20T1%20phones%20are%20proudly%20being%20made%20in%20America.%E2%80%9D">“the
                    T1 phones are proudly being made in America.”</a>
                <br>
                <br>The model number for the T1, 8002, is a complete mystery to all tech news outlets, with one <a
                    href="https://www.stuff.tv/features/5-reasons-to-buy-the-trump-mobile-t1-phone-8002-gold-version/#:~:text=Then%20there%E2%80%99s%20the%20name%3A%20T1%20Phone%208002%2C%20which%20makes%20me%20wonder%20whether%20the%20Trump%20family%20angrily%20tore%20up%208001%20previous%20concepts%20for%20not%20being%20gold%20enough.">satirical
                    review</a> jokingly suggesting that the previous 8001 designs were thrown out for “not being gold
                enough”.
                <br>
                <br>I covered the T1 in <a href="https://ohno.owen.uno/articles/houston-we-have-a-problem">last week's
                    article</a>, so check it out for more info.

                <h3>Now it's the Black Screen of Death</h3>
                <h4>Same acronym, tho.</h4>The Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) is a feared and infamous symbol in
                computing history. It appears when there's a fatal computer error that Microsoft Windows can't recover
                from, and needs to reboot to fix. During the <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201864/crowdstrike-outage-explained-microsoft-windows-bsod">2024
                    CrowdStrike outage</a>, which left over 8 million PCs around the world blue-screened, the BSoD was
                seen everywhere from airports to hospitals to restaurants.
                <br>
                <br>It made its first appearance on Windows 95 as white text on a blue background. Because of the
                severity of these crashes, it earned the nickname “Blue Screen of Death”, and often included information
                on what caused the crash.
                <br>
                <br>Windows NT and Windows 2000 brought more detail to the error messages, providing IT staff and
                computer engineers more context on what caused the issue, helping them better diagnose the problems.
                <br>
                <br>The BSoD generally remained the same with a few small tweaks until Windows 8, which introduced a sad
                face “:(” and a QR code linked to a Microsoft Support page.
                <br>Windows 10 didn't really change things, with only a few minor tweaks to fonts and updated layout to
                fit the system design language.
                <br>
                <br>And so, that brings us to modern day. Now, the Blue Screen of Death looks a lot like the Windows
                Update screen (which is often equally as infuriating as the BSoD). The background is black, the text is
                white, and there's no sad face to offer condolences.
                <br>
                <br>RIP BSoD.
                <br>(There's no doubt, however, that people will still make countless more BSoD memes)
                <br>
